# Form Wizard

**The form wizard is a user interface design pattern that enables untrained users to achieve a goal through a series of steps. The user enters data in each view and proceeds to the next step until completion**

A wizard or multi-step form has many benefits that them more attractive for digital marketers and businesses online compared to single-step forms.

First of all, letâ€™s break down the objectives of why you should use a form on your web-page.

The major reason for using online forms is achieving conversions: The more people fill in the form, the better. The best way to achieve conversions is to build your form with the user-perspective in mind. If the form is easy to understand, clearly structured and fast-loading, then the user has less hesitation to complete it.

Wizard forms show questions in a very user-friendly format. The simple analogy I always use is to compare online forms to personal conversions. In a conversation, you will ask the other person one question at a time, rather than talking about 10 or more different things at once.

Similarly, in a multi-step form, the user will see one question or grouped questions on one screen instead of getting overwhelmed with a full-page consisting of lots of questions.

To summarise, multi-step or wizard forms are more user-friendly, easier to understand and they also create predictability. By showing the user in which form-step they currently are and how much of the form they have yet to complete you create a better experience.
