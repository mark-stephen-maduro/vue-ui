# Component List

**Infopiphany UI** extends [bootstrap framework](https://bootstrap-vue.org/docs/components) and [Tiptap](https://bootstrap-vue.org/docs/components) for `rich-text-editor` and [Vue-ads](https://github.com/arnedesmedt/vue-ads-table-tree) for `tree-table` components.

| Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Dropdown App](app-drawer.md) | The dropdown app is a menu containing all the applications installed on the user's account. The dropdown app is different from the home screen because it contains every installed app and cannot be customized. |
| [Button](button.md) | Use Infopiphany's custom `IpyButton` component for actions in forms, dialogs, and more. Includes support for a handful of contextual variations, sizes, states, and more. |
| [Click Away](click-away.md) | Click Away is a wrapper that acts as a blur event or when a user has clicked outside of its scoped element. `Click Away` may be used in detecting clicks outside of its scoped elements or wrapped elements. |
| [Dropdown](dropdown.md) | Dropdowns are toggleable, contextual overlays for displaying lists of links and actions in a dropdown menu format. |
| [Form Wizard](form-wizard.md) | The form wizard is a user interface design pattern that enables untrained users to achieve a goal through a series of steps. The user enters data in each view and proceeds to the next step until completion |
| [Text Field](text-field.md) | A text field is an input field that users can type into. It has a range of options and supports several text formats including numbers. |
| [Text Editor](tiptap.md) | In most areas of the system where text can be entered, you can control the appearance of your text using the `rich-text-editor`, sometimes called a `WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get)`. |
| [Tree Select](tree-select.md) | A multi-select component with nested options support for Vue.js |
| [Tree Table](tree-table.md) | For full documentation of tree-table please see [tree-table](https://github.com/arnedesmedt/vue-ads-table-tree) |
| [Page Layout](./layout/page-layout.md) | Page layout component is also available for single row layout. The developer can customize each component positioning in this layout. |
| [Tier Layout](./layout/tier-layout.md) | **Infopiphany UI** uses the powerful mobile-first flexbox grid (via the `<b-row>`, `<b-form-row>` and `<b-col>` components) to build layouts of all shapes and sizes thanks to a twelve column system, five default responsive tiers, CSS Sass variables and mixins, and dozens of predefined classes. |
