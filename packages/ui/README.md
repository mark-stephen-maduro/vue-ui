Import the components as desired:

```javascript
import {} from '@infopiphany/ui'
```

## Quick Start

To include Infopiphany UI base styles in your project, simple import the `@infopiphany/ui` main css file:

```css
@import '@infopiphany/ui/dist/infopiphany-ui.css';
```

## Usage with a SCSS preprocessor

If you use a SCSS preprocessor, you may include the base SCSS file instead of `index.css`:

```scss
@import '@infopiphany/ui/src/scss/infopiphany.scss';
```
